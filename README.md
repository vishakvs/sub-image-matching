# sub-image-matching
C code to find coordinates of sub image in a full image. (works on bmp files using libbmp from https://github.com/marc-q/libbmp)

##Not the best way to find subimage coordinates. But it just works. Use it for educational purposes)

# How-to-use
Just compile subimage.c and libbmp.c using any standard c99 compiler. Only standard C libraries used.

# To-do
Need to reduce matching time using good matching algorithm. Learining it now.
